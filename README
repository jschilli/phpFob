phpFob
========


1. DESCRIPTION
==============

phpFob is a PHP implementation of the most excellent CocoaFob at
<http://github.com/gbd/cocoafob/>.


phpFob can generate or decode CocoaFob compatible license codes.  phpFob extends 
the use of CocoaFob and opens up the use of CocoaFob for licensing directly in 
FastSpring <http://www.fastspring.com/>, Shine <http://github.com/tylerhall/Shine> or others.

2. USAGE
========

The best way to get the latest version of the code is to clone the main Git
repository:

git://github.com/jschilli/phpFob.git


licensekey.php has a test function - it illustrates the usage of the library

$lic = make_license('product', 'User Name', 10);
echo "$lic\n";
if (verify_license('product', 'User Name', 10, $lic)) {
	echo "License IS Valid\n";
} else {
	echo "License IS NOT valid\n";
}

should result in something like this:

GAWAE-FAJYB-FRQ52-PJTD6-BXVTP-B56N4-QPL5M-PN2AC-CR2E2-5Z2DV-9746H-T3GJP-TANPE-BQLFA-6STE
License IS Valid

Please DO NOT use the enclosed keys!  They are for test purposes only.
